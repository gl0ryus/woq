#### A note for those who used the [Theme Park][theme.park] nginx mod
Modify your nginx config and remove the lines that introduced the external css, anything after `rewrite ^/qbittorrent/(.*) /$1 break; ` (non inclusive) is something that can be removed. Do not leave -modded, or any other files that are not necessary for nginx to function in the `/etc/nginx/apps/` directory. Reload nginx after making changes by doing `sudo service nginx configtest`, if it returns OK, then proceed and do `sudo service nginx reload`.
